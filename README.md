# OPI - A Package Index for FOAM Projects

![](https://byob.yarr.is/exasim-project/opi/count)

OPI is a package index for FOAM projects.
It has the goal to simplify discovery and installation of community based packages.

# Adding your Package

Adding a package to the index is simple.
Fork this repository, and add the package meta data as a json file to `pkg/<your_package>/metadata.json`.
You can use the template metadata.json file in the root of this repository.
Please note that the package name should be in lower case. 

An example is given below

```
{
    "name": "ogl",                              # required
    "repo": "https://github.com/hpsim/OGL.git", # required
    "description":"GPU capable linear solver",  # A short description to print in CLI max 80 chars
    "type": "lib",                              # optional, possible values: [lib,app,data,solver]
    "version": [">=2304", "<8"],                # optional, required FOAM version possible format examples: [  2304, 8, 0.1.0]
    "requires": ["other-package"]               # optional, list of other OPI packages that need to be installed before  
    "keywords": ["GPU", "linear solver"]        # optional keywords for searching and grouping e.g. turbulence, scheme
}
```

For non-standard (i.e., non-`wmake`â€“based) builds, you can also include a `"build"` field in the `metadata.json` file with a list of shell commands needed to build the package.

# [`styro`](https://github.com/gerlero/styro): community package manager

[`styro`](https://github.com/gerlero/styro) is a community package manager for OpenFOAM that can install and manage packages listed here in OPI.

# [Optional] Index badge in your README

We encourage you to add a badge in your README referencing the index entry for your package.

As an example, dynamic JSON badges from [shields.io](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) can be useful, set:
- `url` to the raw JSON file you PR'd, eg. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exasim-project/opi/refs/heads/main/pkg/ogl/metadata.json`
- `query` to `$.[name,type,version]` for example (optional fields will be ignored if not present)
- `label` to `OPI`
- `labelColor` to `#0cc8cf` and `color` to `#131d36`

You can then paste the link to the badge into your README file, it will look like this:
